Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
-Its importance is that it is crucial in various industries such as healthcare, transport and logistsics, security among others since it is at the core of software applications that power key aspects.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The development of programming languages such as C and Fortran,
-Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and,
-The advent of structured programming in the 1970s and rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Phases of software development life cycle include:
  -Requirements: Gathering and documenting user and system requirements
  -Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
  -Implementation: Writing of code and building the software according to design specifications
  -Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
  -Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers
  -Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodlogy: is a sequential approach with distinct phases which flow downwards like a waterfall. Here, one cycle is worked on to completion then the next cycle is followed for example when working on a mobile application after requirements are gathered the team proceeds to designing the software architecture including the UI for the app and this steps are followed until the final cycle i.e. Maintenance
-Agile methodology: is an iterative and incremental approach which focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change for example a project has kicked off but the product manager/customers keep bringing new requirements after the initial ones were taken and such require flexibility to successfully achieve this.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-A software developer is responsible for building software applications/systems that focus on solving a particular problem whereas a quality assurance engineer is responsible for testing the software built by the software developer and see if it meets the requirements of the users and a project manager is responsible for ensuring that the project from the beginneing to the end is tracked and everyone involved serves and understands their role in the project thereby ensuring deliverables and timelines are met as agreed from the start. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) are software suits that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code such as Atom, Visual studio code, Eclipse whereas Version Control Systems(VCSs) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing requirements which leads to project delays and pressure however adoption of agile methodologies and communication helps manage and mitigate dissapointments

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing is the testing of individual components or modules of software,
-Integration testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems,
-System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole and,
-Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements and esuring it meets these needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
-The importance of this is that the AI models are able to understand one's exact needs and deliver the best results 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague: what is the meaning of life? 
-Improvement: In the context of human anatomy, what is the meaning of life and how can one ensure that they are able to play their part in the universe?
